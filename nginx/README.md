nginx formula
=============

The purpose of this formula is to install the latest stable package from [the official nginx repo](http://nginx.org/packages/).

Config example
--------------

```
nginx:
  install_from_repo: False		# Use this if you don't want to install from the official repo and you prefer the distro repo instead.
```
