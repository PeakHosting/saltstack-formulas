SaltStack Formulas
==================


Here you can see how things are going to be setup in your system.
You are more than welcome to send pull request when you make improvements.

We are also happy to accept support for new software. In order to get started on how to extend this have a look at the already provided formulas, such as the memchacd one.

The final purpose is to provide a repo which can be plugged in directly in SaltStack.
